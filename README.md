# EV Torque Calculator Platinum ‚ö°Ô∏è

Welcome to the **EV Torque Calculator Platinum** ‚Äî your go-to web tool for visualizing electric motor torque curves with precision, presets, and customizability. Perfect for nerds, EV enthusiasts, and anyone who loves that sweet torque graph action.

---

## What Is This?

This project lets you:

- Pick from preset electric motor torque curves (including meme motors like the *some random ahh electric scooter*).
- Customize your own torque curve using intuitive sliders.
- Adjust max torque, max power, max RPM, and calculation precision.
- Generate a detailed torque table output.
- Visualize the torque curve on a sleek chart.
- Export your torque data as a text file.

## Features

- **Custom Torque Curve Sliders:** Tweak ramp-up, plateau, and falloff parameters to craft your ideal torque curve.
- **Multiple Preset Motor Curves:** From Tesla to Porsche Taycan, and even the Scala 1.0TSI for that meme factor.
- **Precision Control:** Control the RPM step size for your torque calculations.
- **Live Graph Rendering:** Instant visual feedback on your torque curve.
- **Export Capability:** Download your torque table for offline use or sharing.
